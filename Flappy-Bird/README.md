# Flappy-Bird

I made this game my senior year of highschool when I was just learning to code, I was very interested in video games at the time so I decided to learn the basics of the **Unity game engine** and the programming language **C#**

This projects involves the use of local save state to save the users highscore, basics of 2d vectors and movement, recieving and handling user input and game loops
