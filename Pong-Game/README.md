# Pong Game

This is a school project and it uses python and the module pygame to create a gui which uses local multiplayer to play the classic game Pong

To play this game the left user uses keys **A** and **Q** for up and down and the right user uses keys **L** and **P** respectively, first to 11 points wins

I have also implemented singleplayer where the user practices their pong skills against an unbeatable AI
